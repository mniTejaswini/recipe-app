🚀 How to Start the Project (After Setup)
🧠 Step 1: Start the Flask Backend

Open a terminal in VS Code and run:

cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py


✅ Flask backend will start on → http://localhost:5000

🧠 Step 2: Start the React Frontend

Open a new terminal in VS Code and run:

cd frontend
npm start


✅ React frontend will open on → http://localhost:3000

⚙️ Optional Commands (Only If Needed)

If you ever reset or reinstall your project:

# Backend setup again (only once)
cd backend
python -m venv venv
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


If node modules were deleted:

cd frontend
npm install

🧩 Notes

Keep both terminals running while using the app.

Don’t close backend until you finish testing.

If you get “Not Found” error → make sure Flask is running properly on port 5000.

To stop servers:

Press Ctrl + C in each terminal.
